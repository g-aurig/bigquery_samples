There are at least 3 reasons to look at product categories by revenue: 
1. Revenue generation: focus on & prioritize the most profitable product categories,
2. Ressource allocation: invest in product development & marketing for the high-revenue categories to further boost sales,
3. Strategic decision making: identify growth opportunities & potential expension areas. 

- A safe sign to prioritize the product category 'Apparel' is how the category dominates with a 6.5 times higher revenue compared to the second highest product category 'New'. 
- What about the product category 'Bags' in row 3? What initiatives could be taken to boost sales within this product category? Talk to your trusted product development and marketing team.

The screenshot shows the [engagement rate by source/medium](https://github.com/g-aurig/bigquery_samples/blob/main/engagementRateBySource_Medium) for the time period 01/11/2020-31/01/2021.

Let's consider 2 reasons to investigate the engagement rate by source/medium:
1. Identify top performing channels: focus efforts & resources on the most effective channels, ultimately maximizing ROI,
2. Understand user behaviour: higher engagement rates indicating visitors from these channels are more likely to be interested in the content/product.

- One insight is that the data quality needs a thourough investigation since engagement rates of 1.0 are highly unlikely.
- Another insight is that the spread of the remaining channels is rather small,i.e. 0.61 to 0.73. Despite users coming from quite different channels the overall engagement rate is high.

There are at least 3 reasons to look at product categories by revenue: 
1. Revenue generation: focus on & prioritize the most profitable product categories,
2. Ressource allocation: invest in product development & marketing for the high-revenue categories to further boost sales,
3. Strategic decision making: identify growth opportunities & potential expension areas.
